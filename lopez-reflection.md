# Release 7: Reflect

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The merge portion gave me a little of trouble during the assignments.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The --help and man were clarified and how they are useful tools when you are stuck on a command

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Pretty stuck on fetch. What makes a good commit comment in their book.

4. What still confuses you about Git?
Just to make sure I know what branches I am in when trying to add changes to my files.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Pretty good. I think Allain and I did a good job listening to each other and taking tips and navigation.
